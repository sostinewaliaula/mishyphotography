                                    Why a Drone Is My Favorite Purchase That I Did Not Need <br>
Drones are appealing to a wide gamut of people, from creatives to tech-heads, to aviation enthusiasts. For me, it was perhaps a blend of all three, but something I couldn't easily justify. Nevertheless, I bought one anyway, and it turned out to be the best poor decision I've ever made.

                                    The Influence of White Balance on Our Perception of the Polarization Effect in Landscape Photography <br>
